# X-Team NN Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Each person will volunteer for their fair share of tasks.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Send message through group text updating the group on your progress when you are done or almost done. Also try to set a reasonable deadline for individual tasks before the due date.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
If we are struggling we will let the others group know and ask for their help/help from others (piazza, TA's, etc.)


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Double check a day or two before the deadlines to ensure that progress is being made.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Just be up front and communicative about everything.
